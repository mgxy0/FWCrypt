# Warnings

 ## Password Management:
 Password Security: Ensure that passwords used for encryption are complex and long (at least 12-16 characters), containing a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Weak passwords can compromise the security of your entire system.
 Password Protection: Keep passwords in a safe place and do not share them with unauthorized people. Using a password manager can help keep your passwords secure.

 ## Data Integrity:
 Backup Data: Before encrypting your data, make sure you have a backup copy. Loss of the encryption password will make it impossible to recover the encrypted data.
 Integrity Verification: After encryption and decryption, verify that the data has not been altered or corrupted.

 ## Execution Environment:
 System Security: Run the program in a safe environment, free of malware or keyloggers that could intercept passwords.
 Security Updates: Keep your operating system and encryption libraries used updated to protect against known vulnerabilities.

 ## Use of the Program:
 Responsible Use: Use the program in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Encryption should not be used for illicit purposes.
 Controlled Environment Testing: Before using the program in production, thoroughly test all features in a controlled environment to ensure that data can be encrypted and decrypted correctly without data loss.
