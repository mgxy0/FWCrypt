# Algorithm for Fibonacci and Woodall Combination


## Sequence Generation:

 1. Generate a sequence of Fibonacci numbers to the desired length.
 2. Generate a sequence of Woodall numbers to the desired length.
 3. Combine the Fibonacci and Woodall numbers using arithmetic and bitwise operations to obtain a unique and complex result.
 4. Use a hashing algorithm (e.g. SHA-256) to transform the combination into a fixed-length key.
 5. Use a key derivation function like PBKDF2 with a salt to make key generation more difficult.

## Algorithm Details
### Generation of Fibonacci and Woodall Sequences:
Fibonacci Sequence:
 The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two previous numbers.
 The formula for generating Fibonacci numbers is:
 ```sh
 F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
 with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.
 ```
Woodall sequence:
 The Woodall sequence is a series of numbers calculated as:
 ```sh
 W(n) = n * 2^n - 1
 ```
### Combining Sequences:
To combine the two sequences to obtain a complex cryptographic key, perform the following steps for each index ii in the sequences:
 Calculate:
 ```sh
 C(i) = (F(i) XOR W(i)) % 256
 ```
 Where XOR represents the bitwise XOR operation, which compares the bits of two numbers and returns 1 if the bits are different, 0 otherwise.
### Key Hashing:
To ensure that the combined key is of fixed length and to increase its security, we use the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. This algorithm converts the combined sequence into a 32-byte byte string.
 The formula to hash the combined key is:
 ```sh
 hashed_key = SHA-256(combined_sequence)
 ```
### Key Derivation with PBKDF2:
To make the derived key even more secure and resistant to brute force attacks, we use PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2). This function uses a salt and a number of iterations to generate the final key.
 The formula to derive the final key is:
 ```sh
 final_key = PBKDF2(hashed_key, salt, iterations=20000, key_length=32)
 ```

## Explanation of the algorithm
Sequence Generation:
 For each number from 1 to 32, we generate the corresponding Fibonacci and Woodall numbers.

Combining Sequences:
 We use the XOR (^) operation to combine the Fibonacci and Woodall numbers and take the form 256 to ensure that each value is a byte.

Hashing the Key:
 We hash the combined key using SHA-256 to get a fixed length key.

Key Derivation:
 We use PBKDF2 with a salt to derive the final key, further increasing security against brute force attacks.

#### This algorithm and its implementation significantly improve the security of the encryption process by using Fibonacci and Woodall numbers in combination with advanced key derivation techniques.
